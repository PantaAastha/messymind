> *Upload a CSV of GA4 events, get a diagnosis with interventions.*

## What it does

Messy Mind analyzes session data to detect psychological friction patterns in the "Messy Middle" — that chaotic space between awareness and purchase. Upload your GA4 events (currently the only supported format), and get a diagnosis with specific interventions to reduce drop-offs.

Built on behavioral economics research, including Google's Messy Middle framework and principles from "Thinking, Fast and Slow."

## Features

**Pattern Detection** — Identifies 4 behavioral friction patterns:
- Comparison Paralysis
- Trust Deficit / Social Proof Gap
- Value Uncertainty / Price Hesitation
- Ambient Shopping

**GA4 Event Support** — Upload CSV exports of GA4 events for analysis

**Actionable Interventions** — Get specific, prioritized recommendations mapped to detected behavioral drivers

**Save & Compare** — Save diagnoses to compare changes over time (requires authentication)

**Export to PDF** — Download detailed diagnostic reports for sharing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.9+

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env.local`:
```bash
